Task 1 ‚Äì Local Network Port Scanning
This repository contains the results and documentation for Task 1 of the Cybersecurity Internship. The objective of this task was to learn how to discover open ports on devices in a local network using Nmap and understand network exposure.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Nmap
Downloaded and installed Nmap from the official website.

Verified installation using:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap --version
2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Local IP Range
Used ipconfig to find the local IP and subnet mask.

IP Address: 10.98.152.169

Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Network Range: 10.98.152.0/24

3Ô∏è‚É£ Perform TCP SYN Scan
Ran the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sS -T4 10.98.152.0/24
4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Hosts and Open Ports
The scan detected 3 live hosts with the following results:

Host IP	Status	Open Ports	MAC Address	Service
10.98.152.76	Up	None	C6:73:5F:DE:DD:F9	-
10.98.152.133	Up	53/tcp	42:4F:2F:9D:72:08	DNS
10.98.152.169	Up	None	(My machine)	-

5Ô∏è‚É£ Research Common Services
Port 53 (DNS): Used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Often runs on servers or routers.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Potential Security Risks
Open DNS port could be vulnerable to:

DNS spoofing or poisoning attacks

DNS amplification for DDoS attacks

No other open TCP services detected on the network hosts.
