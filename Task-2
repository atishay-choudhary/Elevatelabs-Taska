# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## Email Overview:
A suspicious email claiming to be from Apple Support was analyzed for phishing characteristics.

## Identified Phishing Indicators:

1. **Spoofed Sender Email Address**
   - Address used: `security-update@apple-secure.com`
   - This is not a legitimate Apple domain. Apple uses `@apple.com`.

2. **Suspicious Link**
   - Link shown: `https://apple.id.security-check-now.com`
   - This mimics Apple’s website but is not associated with Apple.

3. **Urgent/Threatening Language**
   - Statements like "Failure to verify... will result in permanent suspension" pressure the user.

4. **Generic Salutation**
   - Uses "Dear Customer" instead of the recipient’s actual name.

5. **Attachment**
   - Contains an HTML form: `Apple_Verification_Form.html`, likely to phish login credentials.

6. **Grammar and Spelling**
   - Slight awkward phrasing and formatting typical of phishing emails.

## Conclusion:
This email contains multiple red flags that indicate a phishing attempt aimed at stealing Apple ID credentials.
